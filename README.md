# crateOS
Linux-inspired operating system built to resist attack.

## About
I've really been wanting to do this for a while. I've always been fascinated by the Linux operating system, and by how well it manages things, as compared to Windows (no offense). Obviously, I admit I need lots of help on this, and it's probably useless anyway. But for me, that doesn't matter. If it becomes popular or not, or if it can outperform others or not, I will still have fun and learn a lot.

## Acknowledgements
Thank you so much to the authors at www.linuxjournal.com, who wrote the very helpful article https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/what-does-it-take-make-kernel-0, where I was able to learn how to write my first kernel. If it can be called that ðŸ˜†.
